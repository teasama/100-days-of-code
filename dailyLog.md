### Day 6: August 13

**Today's Progress**: Did a couple lessons on freecodecamp. Started working a little bit with jQuery. 

**Thoughts:** I wasn't really feeling like working on my project exactly but decided that I should copy my exsisting code onto my tablet to work out any questions I might have about what I am doing. AND I will also have my work on mobile when I'm out and about. Why copy it? It's simply how I learn and I really just want to have a solid basics knowledge.

**Link(s) to work:** Don't have one today. 

**Biggest Unanswered Question:** How do I test the code I am writing on my tablet?
